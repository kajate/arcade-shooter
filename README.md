# Never Ending Space

Never Ending Space is an online multiplayer space game where the players battle in two teams to avoid asteroids and collect (some) emojis to gain the most points. Look out for aliens! If you miss them, you loose points! But if you can catch them... who knows how many points you could get!



It is built with Socket.io and Phaser 3.
